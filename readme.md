# GitRuler Section A

This repository is section A of the [GitRuler exercises](https://github.com/UOL-CS/gitruler-exercises).

If you do not already have a your own repository for these exercises [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

## Changing files and committing those changes.

1. Use a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) to add `Manfred Delmonte` to a new line in `files/employees.txt` and `Peaches` to a new line in `files/products.txt`.
1. Stage the changes that you made to the files. Use the `git status` command to check that you have staged all of your changes.
1. Commit your staged changes using the commit message "Add Manfred and Peaches". 

## Submitting the results

Once the exercise is complete, push this repository to the remote. If there are multiple branches for an exercise, make sure that you push them all. 

To ensure that you have you correctly pushed everything that you need to, you could clone the remote repository into a separate folder and re-run gitruler.

## Resources

1. For setting up your git configuration you can see the "Your Identity" and "Your Editor" sections of the [Git Pro Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

For staging and committing modifications to already tracked files take a look at "Staging Modified Files" and "Committing Your Changes" in [Git Pro Book]https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository).
